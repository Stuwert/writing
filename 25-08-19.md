# How Much Project Management is Too Much?


So basically, if you're a software engineer, and you want to deliver things of value, you're going to have to be in project management.

What are the things that people don't actually want to work on:

- Expectation Setting
- System Architecture
- Timeline management
- Follow up
- Client Management


## What does It Look Like?

It looks like following up with people when deadlines get missed, or proactively reaching back out to them before they do. It looks like escalations when there are misunderstandings, or 

All of this is stuff that ostensibly someone else could do. It's theoretically why project managers exist. The problem is that anyone who's not technical enough to do the project isn't going to know what parts of the project are important and which parts can shift around. They're not going to understand what functional delivery in a ticket was actually the impact. They're going to see it as a Gantt chart or as a connected series of dots in a web. They all relate but the semantic meaning is almost entirely lost. So if you want to work on projects that deliver value you're going to have to do some of that. 

But there are limits. Doing it a little bit is a lot different than doing it a lot, especially when it comes to building out a career. 

## Positive Project Management



## Negative Project Management


### Performance Management

Performance management. It's almost always performance management. 

A lot of what gets billed as politics isn't in fact just managing around the fact that there aren't clear expectations up front and can't be managed directly. Some expectation setting is reasonable, everyone is a little different and laying ground rules can go a long way. But if someone (typically in a different division or at a higher level) isn't actually meeting their job competency it causes cascading problems for the entire project that developers have to work around. 

It causes cascading failures of accountability and decision making. And most of the time this comes up in small ways, not big ways. It's the yes/no decision that doesn't get made because someone is an untrustworthy partner, or decisions that get renegotiated. 

### Manual Processes

The other type of negative project management is stuff that becomes manual that could be automated. 

[Insert XKCD] Sure that XKCD diagram exists, but a lot of stuff that happens is "we don't have time to do this well so we're going to do it manually". This is the stuff that absolutely kills engineering culture. It drains the life 

### Doing things without ROI

Something I learned about ROI is that it's not just a way to feel good about functionality you're shipping. It's hard to have conversations about tradeoffs if you don't know what those tradeoffs are supposed to achieve. Who knows if that button that notifies users is a nice to have or a key feature? It depends on what your theory of mind is for a given feature and how it impacts business success. 

This is also the biggest red flag in my opinion. If the expectation is that engineering should do things without understanding how they're measuring success, it's something you can't change via culture or escalation. The number of discussions that 

# How to Draw Useful Boxes

At some point in your software career you're going to end up drawing boxes. 

# How You Do Things Matters
# You're Being Paid for your judgement
# Getting Used to the Shape Of Work

The hardest thing about being a principal engineer has been understanding how I can write code without interrupting teams. Namely, just because I'm wide open today doesn't mean I'm going to be wide open the next two days. And that means I can't start a project I couldn't finish and ship today. It's given me a new perspective on software engineering and its relationship to meetings. Supporting a project isn't just about the time it takes to ship the project. It's also the time it takes to be thoughtful about it and the time it takes to be support it post launch.
