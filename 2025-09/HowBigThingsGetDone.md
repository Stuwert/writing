# Unaccountability and Big Things Getting Done

Unexpectedly two of my favorite books in the last year are _How Big Things Get Done_ and _The Unaccountability Machine_. You wouldn't really think that these concepts relate to each other all that strongly. But they do. 

They're both about the way that institutional knowledge isn't just built within a person, but within the systems that person is a part of, and that how work gets done is a key determinant to what actually gets accomplished. 

One of my strongest beliefs as a software engineer is that product management ends up being one of the biggest levers for the success of someone's engineering role or career. If product is constantly delivering new goals that change every week/day, it doesn't matter much how strong of an engineer you are, it's going to be hard to deliver the type of value that engineers actually can. 

None of this is really new persay. Lots of people have pointed out that the value of a software engineer is their ability to understand and operate within the system they're building on. 

### How Things Go Wrong

What's interesting about both of the books is they spend a lot of time talking about the ways systems can break down, and what happens as a result. Basically long tails are bad, once you get in the long tail world everything can get much worse than you expect. 

But also, they spend a lot of time thinking about how systems can mostly function in a degraded state. Two concepts pop into my head related to this:

1. Elon's takeover of a twitter 
2. Someone important losing their job

People tend to assume with systems that they will either immediately fall apart, or if they don't, whatever was removed wasn't actually that important. 

But that's not really the takeaway here. Rather, what actually happens is more akin to a large boat listing slightly off course over time. Big systems can withstand a huge amount of change and mostly continue to function as-is without a huge discrepancy in what they're doing until a catastrophic event occurs, the signals being delivered in ways that never get back to central planners.

You don't notice capacity to plan big projects has been completely gutted until you actually try to undertake a big project. 

### Embedded Knowledge Is Real and Valuable

There's research that shows that "star employees" cannot simply transition their stardom from one company to the next when they switch roles. In fact, there's no guarantee that the stardom will persist at all. This shows two highlights that both books get at. 

1. Knowledge is embedded within the systems that maintain it. _How Big Things Get Done_ would call this experience, and _The Unaccountability Machine_ would call it the black box of various systems of control. 
2. You can't atomize that knowledge into its component parts. 

One of the most fascinating conclusions of _How Big Things Get Done_ is that when you start a new project you cannot simply add up all of the component parts to get at a timeline. Rather, you must compare the outcome of similarly scoped projects to get at a reasonable expectation of delivery. Both point to this idea that systems aren't the sum of their atomic components. They are the sum of the relationship between the systems those components make up. 


### Feedback Structures Matter

One of the most interesting conclusions of _The Unaccountability Machine_ is to answer the question of why so much middle management spends its time with accountability management. I.e. Why do middle managers try to diffuse accountability away from themselves?

Well, let's look at _How Big Things Get Done_ as an example. If you're not doing things like estimating based on best in class comparisons or breaking problems into smaller components, and you're not the explicit decision maker who gets to drive those decisions, then the appropriate next step is to make sure you can diffuse as much responsibility as possible away from you (or leave). Said another way, the less direct the feedback is to make changes to *how* things happen, the more focus there will be on accountability diffusion. 

## Where To Go From Here

Ok so there's lots of pointing out how things are bad, what does that mean for managers and higher level contributors? I think there are two primary takeaways:

1. Feedback mechanisms matter. This is something you can poke at in 1-1s and in interview processes. Asking questions like "When things break down, how does that get resolved" or "What does accountability look like". Also digging in on questions like "How does the business measure project success?" and "What happens when problems go sideways" are good ways to understand and adapt what you're doing.
2. Problem solving mechanism: When things go wrong, both books work in conjunction to ask a variety of useful questions. Like... "What were the incentives that created the decisions that lead to the failure?". "What system broke down? Was it immediate decision making or higher level change?" and "Who is responsible for making the necessary system design changes?"
