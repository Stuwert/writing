# RPS 21

RPS 21 is a game that attempts to be a combination of Blackjack and  and Rock Paper Scissors

This is a follow up to a couple of previous art attempts where I've made stickers and customized Pokemon cards for people. The cards were interesting because everyone wanted to know how to battle with them, but we didn't really have the infrastructure to do that. It's hard to like... build out an entire 60 card deck and then have people play them. 

So I was inspired to make my own game. The goal is something that's simple enough to play and learn quickly. 

## The Start

I initially started out with a design that was pure Rock Paper Scissors. The Blackjack component is that you'd start with one card flipped over and one card is left face down. But this ended up with a super convoluted system of trying to figure out how various combinations of Rock, Paper and Scissors relate to each other. Is a Rock-Scissors better than a Scissors-Paper?

I even created this super convoluted diagram of how might that look. One of the primary concerns I had, especially for a brand new game that people might not understand is that it would have to be pretty legible quickly. And that just wasn't it.

I also kinda realized that if folks got to pick both of the cards they put down it would be pretty easy to game so one player won, or the outcome would be pretty obvious from the start. If you played Rock, for example, you'd always play the card that's most likely to fix the weakness. And, if you wanted to make it more complicated... like what card came first. So Rock-Scissors would be different than Scissors-Rock. I'm unconvinced how fun this would be, and it's definitely way too complicated for anyone to pick up and easily learn.

## The Evolution

From there, I realized the answer was always in front of me. Given that I wanted the design of these to feel a bit "gamblingy" and blackjacky, what if the second round was just straight up blackjack? 

So that led to a new set of rules. Shuffle up your small deck (15 cards?), and draw three. Then pick one card to put face down, and draw one card off the top of the deck (without revealing it). The first cards are straight up Rock Paper Scissors. Whoever has the better card wins. The second round is blackjack. Whoever has the higher number without going over 21 wins. 

## The Ante

The final piece of this is an inspiration from games like Marvel Snap. I wanted there to be an ante portion that fed back into the game. 

This is the like... trust factor. Everyone gets a couple of stickers that they can modify their cards with. The catch??? They can only apply them after they wager them in a game. After you win a game you get to apply a sticker that you won during the game (you collect the rest). So the goal is to play around with the wagering as a way to get your opponents to fold.


This also created some fun play, where the losing player gets to choose to ante into Blackjack or not. They can choose to fold if they think their hand is weak!

## Build a Bear, But for Cards

This I stole from Gambrinous Games' Cardpocalypse, which had all of the vibes of trading cards as a kid but with the added fun that you get to modify the cards in front of you. I figured it would be fun to add in some new ideas to switch up the gameplay.

- Forcing your opponent to flip over another card
- Getting to flip over another card for yourself
- Modifying the numbers on your card


There's also another little unintentional twist that I was gifted. Because these are playing cards, you get to have different modifiers for the top versus the bottom.
