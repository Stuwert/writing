# Mail Sorter

Parsing and processing large volumes of text seems like something that LLMs are broadly quite good at. And doing so would have a direct and net benefit on my life. 

Inspired by Zach Gage's workflow for "The Hole" I set out to build something into my own workflow related to processing and dealing with email from people that I didn't know about. I already have a fledgling workflow built into my email where pretty much only people I verifiably know and care about make it into my inbox.

Everything else, the unknowns ends up in the "Screener" pile. It's something I kept over from Hey.com, even though I ended up moving to Fastmail because it was faster and cheaper. 

My primary goal was to create a system that would quickly parse my emails into various outputs where I could review the messages as necessary. 

- Adding Batching
- Giving the AI Tools to work with
- Creating a small database to easily take action on known emails
- Logging outputs
- Flag for viewed messages
